Vision
======

Having a clear, documented vision keeps you focused and helps you avoid
“scope creep” from others’ contributions.

About milestones
----------------
A milestone is an event that receives special attention. It is often put at the
end of a stage to mark the completion of a work package or phase. Milestones
can be put before the end of a phase so that corrective actions can be taken,
if problems arise, and the deliverable can be completed on time.

- A tagged version of the project that’s ready for the next release
- A phase of the project in which previously known bugs have been addressed
- A phase of the project in which new featured have been introduced
- A phase of the project in which certain features have been deprecated or
  removed (for any number of factors)
